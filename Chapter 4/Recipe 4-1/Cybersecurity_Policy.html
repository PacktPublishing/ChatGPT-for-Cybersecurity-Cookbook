Policy Review and Update</h2>
<p>To ensure the cybersecurity policy remains effective and aligned with the evolving cybersecurity landscape, regulatory requirements, and organizational objectives, it is imperative that the policy undergoes a regular review and update process. This section outlines the procedures for the review cycle, updating the policy, and incorporating stakeholder feedback.</p>
<h3>16.1. Review Cycle</h3>
<p>The cybersecurity policy shall be reviewed on a biennial basis, or more frequently if significant changes in technology, business processes, laws, or regulatory requirements occur. The review cycle ensures that the policy reflects current best practices, addresses new threats, and complies with the latest legal and regulatory standards.</p>
<p>The review process will be initiated by the Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) team, which will be responsible for scheduling the review, coordinating with relevant stakeholders, and documenting any changes or amendments to the policy. The GRC team will maintain a review log that captures the date of each review, the persons involved, the areas of the policy reviewed, and the outcomes of the review.</p>
<p>In addition to the scheduled reviews, the policy shall also be subject to an ad-hoc review in response to any significant cybersecurity incidents, breaches, or discoveries of vulnerabilities within the organization’s infrastructure that may impact the policy's relevance or effectiveness.</p>
<h3>16.2. Updating the Policy</h3>
<p>Following the review, any required updates to the cybersecurity policy will be drafted by the GRC team with input from relevant stakeholders, such as IT security personnel, legal advisors, department heads, and where appropriate, external consultants. Updates must be documented with a clear rationale for each change, including references to new threats, technologies, business practices, or regulatory requirements that necessitate the update.</p>
<p>All updates to the policy will be version-controlled, with a new version number and date of issue assigned. The updated policy will include a summary of changes made since the previous version to facilitate easy identification of amendments. The GRC team will ensure that the updated policy is communicated to all relevant parties and that previous versions of the policy are archived for historical reference and audit purposes.</p>
<p>The approval of updates to the cybersecurity policy will follow the organization’s established approval process for policy changes. This typically involves review and sign-off by senior management, legal counsel, and other key decision-makers.</p>
<h3>16.3. Stakeholder Feedback</h3>
<p>Stakeholder feedback is an essential component of the policy review and update process. The GRC team will solicit feedback from a broad range of stakeholders, including but not limited to employees, management, IT staff, and external partners, to ensure that the policy is practical, clear, and enforceable.</p>
<p>A formal mechanism for collecting and reviewing feedback will be established, which may include surveys, interviews, focus groups, or feedback forms. Stakeholders will be encouraged to provide feedback on any aspect of the policy they believe is unclear, outdated, or could be improved. The GRC team will compile and analyze the feedback, integrating it into the policy review process where appropriate.</p>
<p>Feedback will be sought not only during the formal review cycle but also on an ongoing basis, as continuous improvement is a key objective of the cybersecurity policy. Stakeholders will be informed of how their feedback has been addressed to ensure transparency and to encourage ongoing engagement with the policy maintenance process.</p>
