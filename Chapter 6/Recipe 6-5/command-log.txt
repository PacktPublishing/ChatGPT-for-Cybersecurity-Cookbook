Request: what is my IP address?
Command: ```cmd
ipconfig | findstr /i "IPv4" | findstr /r "[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+"
```
This command will output the IPv4 address of your machine. It uses `ipconfig` to get all network configuration information, then `findstr` to filter out lines containing "IPv4", and finally another `findstr` to match only those lines that contain a valid IPv4 address pattern (a series of numbers separated by dots).

The `/i` option in the first `findstr` command makes it case-insensitive, so it will also match "ipv4". The `/r` option in the second `findstr` command allows us to use a regular expression for pattern matching. The pattern `[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+` matches any string of numbers separated by dots, which is what an IPv4 address looks like.

Command: ```cmd
ipconfig | findstr /r "IPv4"
```
This command will output the IPv4 address of your machine, which is what you are looking for. The `findstr` command filters out all lines that do not match the regular expression `/r "IPv4"` (which means "search for lines containing 'IPv4'").

If you want to get the IPv6 address as well,

This command will output the IPv4 address of your machine, which is what you are looking for. The `findstr` command filters out all lines that do not contain the string "IPv4", and the `/i` flag makes it case-
