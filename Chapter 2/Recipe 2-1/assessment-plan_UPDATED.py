Provide a thorough and descriptive introduction and as much detail and description as possible throughout the plan. The plan should not only assessment of technical vulnerabilities on systems but also policies, procedures, and compliance. It should include the use of scanning tools as well as configuration review, staff interviews, and site walk-around. All recommendations should following industry standard best practices and methods. The plan should be a minimum of 1500 words.\n\
        Create the plan so that it is specific for the following details:\n\
        Network Size: {network_size}\n\
        Number of Nodes: {number_of_nodes}\n\
        Type of Devices: {type_of_devices}\n\

        Expected deliverables of the assessment: {deliverables}\n\
        Audience: {audience}\n\
        Provide the plan using the following format and observe the markdown language:\n\
        #Vulnerability Assessment Plan\n\
        ##Introduction\n\
        Thorough Introduction to the plan including the scope, reasons for doing it, goals and objectives, and summary of the plan\n\
